Welcome to Trent Fine Art Context

Connected through the Context lectures which take place on Wednesdays, this is a reactive space to collect contextual references from everyone in Fine art (all years, all staff).

It will grow, over the next few months, into an independent archive for all of us to use - students on the course can store contextual references they have come across from studio conversations, tutorials and seminars with staff and those 'moments' when you aren't thinking about your practice but something strikes you.

Staff can use this space to illustrate relevant artist & cultural references while they are in the studios and can load relevant material directly from the exhibitions, conferences and cultural events they are involved with.

Welcome to a **new space** for contextualisation!
